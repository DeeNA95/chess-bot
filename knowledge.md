# Project Knowledge Base

## Development Guidelines

### Workflow Strategy

- **Python First**: Always experiment and prototype in Python first to validate ideas, algorithms, and logic.
- **C++ Migration**: Once the Python implementation is ready and verified, implement the performance-critical components in C++.

### User Context

- **Role**: AI Engineer (Assume technical proficiency, familiarity with ML/RL concepts, and preference for technical depth).
